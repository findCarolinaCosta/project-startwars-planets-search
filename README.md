## Project report
This project was very special for me, in it I was able to put more into practice my knowledge in javascript and pure css. And I can say that I enjoyed making animation using only pure css, it was incredible to know a little more about what I can be able to do, being inside the use and how to manipulate new information in the world of technology. As in this project I fixed better how to manipulate SVG image. Gratitude is what remains and with more time I will be able to improve it.
